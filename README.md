# rpgwetsocks
WebSockets plug-in for RPG Maker MV. It allows multiple users to connect to a server to send data between. This will utilize the class FormBarâ„¢ that will act like a healthbar that will be impacted when students answer a quiz question correctly.

The server is initialized by a host computer and students connect as clients, freely able to interact with preset console commands. 

This plug-in was created by **Worse Company**.
